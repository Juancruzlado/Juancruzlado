# Juan Cruz Lado - @Juancruzlado

## What's up! i'm Juan Cruz, currently a software developer 

I work as a Software Developer & Pentester, also fullstack dev freelancer. 
I love intellectual challenges & every learning oportunity is encouraged and appreciated!

### Interests & Learning

:seedling: Im currently embarqued in self-study of C & C++ plus assembly language, but currently work with PHP and Bash.
I also like to dabble into playing CTFs like HackTheBox, or TryHackme, besides doing reverse engineering.

### Hiring Status
Im open to new Job Opportunities! and looking for reasonable offers. Especially related to Backend of complex systems, or PenTesting/Red Team Cyber Security Activities, as well as AppSec.

### Current Personal Attributes 

My strongest attribute in programming is the backend in symfony projects, specifically when desigining testable services which interact with the model of the application to produce relevant data to be showcased in the CRUD part of the app
I'm a project leader right now, undergoing various lead efforts in building new webapps and APIs as well as maintaining old and complex systems with state machine like functionalities. I learned a lot about Docker, Databases, Networking, HTTP, Web Servers, API, Error handling and debugging, fixing production when it's down. Processing with async queries to maintain DBs and syncing it with Logic Filters on the State Machine which affects all private Services from the WebApp, etc. 
Also i'm part of an SSR team that manages Api Gateway, Authuentication and Architechture of our microservices. 
Linux is my preferred OS for Developing and Pentesting, due to how easy to use it is. I love Learning new stuff all the time and keeping up to date on the industry of information technology as a whole!  
My future interests would be definately related to low level stuff || Microservices && SRE activites || More Advanced Pen-Testing activities.
I'd also love to contribute to Open Source projects, find CVEs and contribute to making the internet a better place for everyone one day, when my skills back it up. 
I'm currently learning Golang as my second language. So PHP and Golang it is. My approach is to make lots of projects.
